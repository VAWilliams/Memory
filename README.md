# Memory
Memory (also known as Concentration) is a card game played with one or more players. Using a standard card deck (including both jokers) the players shuffle the deck and lay all of the cards face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The objective of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. Concentration can be played with any number of players or as solitaire.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
